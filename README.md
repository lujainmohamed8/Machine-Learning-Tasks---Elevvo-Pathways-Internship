🚀 Machine Learning Projects

A collection of Python-based Machine Learning projects covering regression, classification, clustering, recommendation systems, and forecasting. Each project includes data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization using real-world datasets. Jupyter Notebooks and datasets are provided for easy exploration.

📂 Projects

🎓 Student Score Prediction – Predict students’ exam scores using linear & polynomial regression.

🛍️ Customer Segmentation – Segment customers based on income & spending scores using K-Means and DBSCAN.

🏦 Loan Approval Prediction – Predict loan approvals with classification models and handle class imbalance with SMOTE.

🎬 Movie Recommendation System – Recommend movies using user-based collaborative filtering & similarity measures.

📈 Sales Forecasting (Walmart Dataset) – Forecast Walmart store sales using historical data & regression/time-series techniques.
